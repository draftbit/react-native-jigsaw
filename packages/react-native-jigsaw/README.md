## Publishing

After your last commit, run `npm version`. Probably minor or patch. We only run major for major Expo releases.

Then run:

```sh
yarn publish:both
```

If that doesn't work, you can manually run the script that lives inside `publish.sh`. Either directly: `./publish.sh` or by copying the steps within that file
